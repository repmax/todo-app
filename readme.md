# Todo App
	
This is a barebones Todo web app. Add, complete, and remove tasks – it's that simple. 

This app was developed as an experiment in building reactive PWAs with vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules), [Lit](https://lit.dev/), and IndexedDB – no build tools or network requests needed. This approach is not only great for creating transparent and secure web apps but also likewise browser extensions.

Happy tasking!
